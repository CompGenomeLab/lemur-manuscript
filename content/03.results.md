## Results

### Excised oligomer length distribution in mouse lemur


### Identical CPD and (6-4)PP dinucleotide frequency between human and lemur


### Prominent transcription-coupled repair in mouse lemur


### Conserved repair rates between homologous regions of two primates


### Repair profile association is correlated with conservation and expression


### Same cells from two primates show higher correlation relative to two different cells from the same organism

## Abstract 


Nucleotide excision repair is a primary DNA repair mechanism for repairing an array of bulky DNA adducts. 
Correspondingly, genome-wide mapping of nucleotide excision repair with XR-seq [2], provides comprehensive profiling of DNA damage repair. 
By the assembly of the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) genome at chromosome-scale, we were able to achieve a direct comparison of DNA damage repair profiles between two primates: lemur and human. 
We derived fibroblast cell lines from mouse lemur and expose them to UV followed by XR-seq protocol to reveal the repair map. 
Then we performed comparative analysis of the repair maps between human and lemur fibroblasts. 
In order to assess and compare the DNA excision repair distributions in human and mouse lemur genomes in an unbiased way, we have aligned two genomes and identified the homologous regions between them.

Nucleotide excision repair is a primary DNA repair mechanism that removes bulky DNA adducts such as UV-induced pyrimidine dimers. 
Correspondingly, genome-wide mapping of nucleotide excision repair with eXcision Repair sequencing (XR-seq), provides comprehensive profiling of DNA damage repair. 
A number of XR-seq experiments at a variety of conditions for different damage types revealed heterogenous repair in the human genome.
Although human repair profiles were extensively studied, how repair maps vary between primates is yet to be investigated.
Here, we characterized the genome-wide UV-induced damage repair in gray mouse lemur,*Microcebus murinus*, in comparison to human.
We derived fibroblast cell lines from mouse lemur and exposed them to UV irradiation.
Following repair events were captured genome-wide by XR-seq protocol 1 hour and 5 minutes after irradiation for cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) and 6-4 pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts ([6-4]PP), respectively. 
Mouse lemur repair profiles were analyzed in comparison to the equivalent human fibroblast datasets.
We found that overall UV sensitivity, repair efficiency, and transcription-coupled repair levels differ between two primates.
Despite this, comparative analysis of human and mouse lemur fibroblasts revealed that genome-wide repair profiles of the homologous regions between the primates are highly correlated. 
This correlation is stronger for the highly expressed genes.
With the inclusion of an additional XR-seq sample derived from another human cell line in the analysis, we found that fibroblasts between two primates repair lesions in a more similar pattern relative to two distinct human cell lines.
These results suggest that mouse lemurs and humans, and possibly primates in general, share similar repair mechanism as well as genomic variance distribution, albeit their variable repair efficiency.

## Discussion

XR-seq methodology has become prominent in genome-wide profiling of nucleotide excision repair at single nucleotide resolution. 
This technique has been applied to a variety of model organisms from human to bacteria. 
Although genome-level understanding in human repair behaviour is relatively well established in the recent years, the association of the repair behaviour and genome-wide distribution in the comparision with close organisms was lacking.
With this study, we established the differences and similarities between mouse lemur and human.
First, we observed repair effciency differences between two genomes. 
Like in humans, (6-4)PP was much quickly completed compared to CPD in lemur. 
Both (6-4)PP and CPD repair efficiencies were apparently slower in mouse lemur fibroblasts relative to NHF1 cells. 
This fact is also verified with the survival assays which show that lemur cell lines were more sensitive to UV, which containes both damage types. 

Interestingly, we also observed that TCR was much more efficient in lemurs compared to human especially in CPD repair. 
(6-4)PP TCR was not prominent as it was previously showed and as immunoslot blot assays suggest (6-4)PP repair is fast and therefore mostly repaired by GR rather than TCR. 
We observed similar TS and NTS repair signal for (6-4)PP in genic regions, also suggesting GR is the primary subpathway to repair (6-4)PP.
A striking fact is the inverse correlation between TCR, which is measured by TS/NTS repair signal, and overall repair efficiencies.
Mouse lemurs with more efficient TCR falls behind in overall repair compared to human. 
A possible explanation to this observation is that global repair is the main determinant of the repair efficiency. 
XR-seq yields the entire nucleotide excision repair events with no distinction between TCR and GR. 
For this reason, GR and TCR efficiencies are relative to each other.
Like the relativity in any RNA-seq which cannot give out the total transcription levels, XR-seq also gives the relative distribution of the repair events. 
Therefore, measured "TCR efficiency" actually corresponds to "GR deficiency" in XR-seq profile.
In other words, when the damage is not efficiently recognized by GR pathway, TCR takes over the recognition and removes DNA lesions in TS.
The previously observed high TCR levels in *Arabidopsis thaliana* [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03922-5] and mouse [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1804493115] also suggest relatively poor GR efficiency in these organisms.

Human evolution has been under investigation since the time of Charles Darwin. 
Comparative analyses between human and other animals revealed significant shared and human-specific features. 
With the era of molecular biology started with DNA structure was discovered in 1953, it has been possible to enlight molecular features between humans and their relatives.
Primates are particularly interesting in human morphology studies due to their common features and certain mental abilities. 
Primtates are an extremely diverge group comprising of varies size bodies ranging from 100 grams to 150kg. 
Mouse lemurs stand out as the smallest primate. 
Also, the common ancestor of humans and mouse lemurs is the common ancestor of all organisms in the primate order. 
For this reason, features that are shared between humans and mouse lemurs did likely exist in the common ancestor of primates and therefore are likely still shared in the primates of today.

In this study, we found that UV repair efficiency in mouse lemurs are lower that humans. 
Why humans have a better UV repair capacity than mouse lemurs should be considered from an evolutionary perspective.
Mouse lemurs are nocturnal and they are adapted to an inactive state (torpor) during the day. 
Physical inactivity requires mouse lemurs to stay away from sun light during the day and so that they are not exposed to UV as much as humans are. 
As nucleotide excision repair is the only method to cope with bulky DNA lesions in these organisms, they can survive with relatively lower capacity of repair.

We have a limited knowledge on the epigenetic arhitecture of mouse lemurs as chromatin data have been derived from them. 
Prior to this study, it was unknown whether repar profiles between two primates are similar. 
Our work revealed that human and mouse lemur fibroblasts are significantly similar with respect to their preference on which genomic region to repair first. 
This bias is likely to be caused by the chroatin structure as previously shown in other ogranisms [@doi:10.1038/s41467-019-08290-2].
Damage distribution was known to be homogenous at large genomic scales [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1706522114]. 
Therefore, it is safe to assume that repair preference is the major factor for XR-seq heterogeneity.
The repair profiles of human and lemur fibroblasts are much more similar to each other than the ones between two distinct human cell lines. 
Moreover, (6-4)PP and CPD repair profiles are more similar to themselves, suggesting similar repair dynamics between two organisms.
Further studies on mouse lemur epigenetics will possibly explain the most differentiated genomic repair levels in mouse lemurs. 
Better understanding mouse lemur genomics will provide additional insight into human evolution, repair and mutagenesis.
